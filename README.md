## Scripts to install [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/), and [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) on the [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org).

### Options for TAILS:

1. Run `tailsjoin.sh` on a minimal system without enough disk space to store the blockchain. This will use blockr.io (Coinbase) to check address balances and confirmed transactions. This is over Tor, of course, but still not optimal for privacy. [Detailed Guide Minimal](https://tailsjoin.github.io/guides/install_guide.html#withoutbitcoin)

2. Run `tailsjoin-fullnode.sh` on either a system with enough disk space to hold the blockchain, or a minimal system with enough external storage to store the blockchain (50GB~). This is the suggested method for privacy and true control. [Detailed Guide Full Node](https://tailsjoin.github.io/guides/install_guide.html#withbitcoin)

### For a minimal system follow the steps below, or use the guides in the wiki.

You must start Tails with "More options" setting in the beginning (Persistence is optional) and set an administrator password no matter which script you run.

All scripts are signed with my gpg key: [`44C5 398E A821 BB41 A0C0  7052 1B91 84DF 9E11 7718`](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/wiki/GnuPG-Key)

1. `cd /home/amnesia/Persistent` (optional)
2. `git clone https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin`
3. `cd tailsjoin`
4. `gpg --recv-keys 44C5398EA821BB41A0C070521B9184DF9E117718`
5. `gpg --verify tailsjoin.sh.asc tailsjoin.sh`
6. `./tailsjoin.sh`
    
Be aware, the script will prompt for the administrator password several times throughout.

After installation you will have to add `torify` to every command that does blockchain lookups. [Detailed explanation](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/commit/0b42441277dfe77bccfefe6075cb688c0b603e4a).

Examples:

    torify python wallet-tool.py <wallet_file>
    torify python sendpayment.py -N 4 <amount> <destination_address>
